# MidProjectBDD
This is the mid semester project in Concurrent and Distributed Programming course. 
In this project we use sequential erlang. 
The input is a boolean function, and the program has 2 functions:
1. Convert the boolean function to BDD tree
2. Recieve values for the variables of the tree and return a result
